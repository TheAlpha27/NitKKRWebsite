                <p>The campus extends over an area of 300 acres imaginatively laid down on a picturesque landscape. It
                    presents a spectacle of harmony in architecture and natural beauty. The campus has been organised
                    into three functional sectors:

                    Hostels for the students,

                    Instructional buildings and Residential sector for the staff.

                    Hostels for students are located towards Eastern side of the campus in the form of cluster. Three
                    storey buildings of hostels provide comfortable accommodation and pleasing environment to students.

                    The instructional buildings have been located between the two residential sectors in order to reduce
                    walking distance. A full fledged health centre manned by qualified doctors, a Post Office and a
                    branch of the State Bank of India are located at convenient points on the Campus.</p>

                    <img src="director.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Dr. Satish Kumar, Director of NIT KKR</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    Being the Director of an ‘Institution of National Importance ‘is a matter of pride as well as a
                    burden of responsibility. This position has been held by many stalwarts who have nurtured this
                    institution to where it is today and given it a glorious past of over fifty years. Now, as the baton
                    has passed on to me, I realize that it is for me to lay a roadmap that would take this institution
                    to even greater heights.

                    NIT Kurukshetra has been successfully fulfilling its mandate of developing competent professionals
                    to serve not only our country, but the world as a whole. More than thirty thousand alumni proudly
                    consider this institution their Alma Mater. Many of them have occupied important positions across
                    the country and the globe and have made meaningful contributions to their professions and to
                    advancing the quality of life through their innovative ideas. I applaud their contributions.

                    We live at a time when our country is striving to occupy its deserving place among the developed
                    countries of the world. This can happen only if technology leads the way. Today we hardly have any
                    technology that we can rightfully claim as having originated in this country. That makes it
                    imperative that we develop an ecosystem, both at the macro level and micro level, that would
                    facilitate creation of new technologies. I strongly believe that as an institution of technology,
                    our primary goal has to be develop such an ecosystem where students are encouraged to go beyond
                    merely acquiring knowledge to applying knowledge for practical purposes. Having come from a research
                    background and having seen, at close quarters, what meaningful research output can do for the growth
                    and prestige of the country, I am convinced that research has to be a thrust area for our
                    institutions of higher learning. I would strive to provide that thrust in this institution. If we
                    succeed in enthusing our faculty, staff and students towards this end, our institute would become a
                    cradle of creative and innovative ideas that can help develop new technologies, which, in turn,
                    would transform our country.

                    Located in Dharmkshetre Kurukshetre, where the good fought the evil and emerged successful, a stress
                    on value-education should come naturally to this institution. For the present-day students who are
                    targeting success in the material world, it is difficult, even confusing, to be receptive to the
                    idea of inculcating ethics and values in their thinking and practice. But that cannot be a reason
                    for not making it a part of the education we provide the budding professionals. I make no lofty
                    claims in this regard, except that we are constantly gripped by the need to somehow make this a part
                    of our teaching-learning process so that the outcome of this process is not only a competent
                    professional but a compassionate human being.

                    I heartily welcome everyone who visits this website, to the portals of this institution!
